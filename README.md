##  What is it?

**Simple Shell** is a basic implementation of a UNIX command line interpreter written in C.  
The program reproduces the minimal behavior of a shell by displaying a prompt, reading user input, and executing commands using `fork()` and `execve()`.

This project aims to provide a deeper understanding of UNIX system programming concepts such as:
-  Process management (`fork()`, `execve()`, `wait()`)
-  Environment variables handling
-  PATH resolution and command search
-  Error management and signal handling

---

## Supported Features

| Feature | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Interactive prompt | Displays a prompt and waits for user input |
| Command execution | Uses `fork()` and `execve()` |
| Commands with arguments | Handles arguments passed to commands |
| PATH handling | Searches executables using the PATH variable |
| Environment | Passes `environ` to `execve()` |
| Built-in `exit` | Exits the shell |
| Built-in `env` | Prints the current environment |
| Error handling | Handles invalid commands and execution errors |
| EOF handling | Handles `Ctrl + D` (end of file) |
| Optimization | `fork()` is not called if the command does not exist |

## Requirements

- **OS**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Compiler**: GCC 9.4.0 or higher
- **Editor**: vi, vim, emacs, or VS Code
- **Git**: Version control system
- **Style**: Code compliant with the Betty style guide

---

## How to Compile

### Using Makefile (Recommended)

```bash
# Compile the project
make

# Or compile and run immediately
make run

# Compile with debug symbols
make debug

# Clean object files
make clean

# Clean everything
make fclean

# Rebuild from scratch
make re

# Run with Valgrind
make valgrind

# Show all available commands
make help
```

### Manual Compilation

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 -Iinclude src/*.c -o simple_shell
```

---

## Usage Examples

### Starting the Shell

```bash
$ ./simple_shell
$ 
```

### Basic Commands
---
### Expected output

```bash
$ ./simple_shell
$ ls
AUTHORS  README.md  simple_shell  Makefile  src/  include/
$ pwd
/home/user/holbertonschool-simple_shell
$ echo "Hello, World!"
Hello, World!
$ env
PATH=/usr/bin:/bin
HOME=/home/user
USER=user
$ exit
```

### With Arguments

```bash
$ ./simple_shell
$ ls -la /tmp
total 48
drwxrwxrwt 12 root root 4096 Jan  8 10:30 .
drwxr-xr-x 20 root root 4096 Jan  1 00:00 ..
$ cat /etc/os-release
NAME="Ubuntu"
VERSION="20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa)"
$ exit
```
---

## Error Handling

- If a command cannot be found, an error message is displayed
- The shell continues running after an error
- No process is created if the command does not exist

### Example: 
```bash
$ ./simple_shell
$ wrong_command
./simple_shell: 1: wrong_command: not found
$ another_wrong_cmd
./simple_shell: 2: another_wrong_cmd: not found
$ ls
AUTHORS  README.md  simple_shell
$ exit
```
---

## Valgrind Tests

To check for memory leaks:

```bash
# Using Makefile (recommended)
make valgrind

# Or manually
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 -g -Iinclude src/*.c -o simple_shell
valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --track-origins=yes ./simple_shell
```

### Expected result (no leaks)

```
==75837== HEAP SUMMARY:
==75837==     in use at exit: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==75837==   total heap usage: 2 allocs, 2 frees, 1,144 bytes allocated
==75837== 
==75837== All heap blocks were freed -- no leaks are possible
==75837== 
==75837== For lists of detected and suppressed errors, rerun with: -s
==75837== ERROR SUMMARY: 0 errors from 0 contexts (suppressed: 0 from 0)
```

man ./man_pages/simple_shell.1.en

# French version
man ./man_pages/simple_shell.1.fr
```

## Learning Objectives

After completing this project, you should be able to explain:

- What is a shell and how it works
- The difference between a function and a system call
- How to create processes with `fork()`
- How to execute programs with the `execve()` family
- How to wait for a child process with `wait()`
- What is the environment and how to access it
- How to handle the PATH variable
- How to implement built-in commands

---

## Running Tests

Run the automated test suite:

```bash
# Make sure the shell is compiled
make

# Run all tests
bash tests/test_shell.sh
```

The test script will verify:
- Basic command execution (ls, pwd, echo)
- Built-in commands (env, exit)
- Error handling
- EOF handling
- PATH resolution
- Multiple commands execution
